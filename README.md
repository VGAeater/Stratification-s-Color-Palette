## Classic

The big box is your selected color.

The Three bars on the right you can drag your mouse on and change the color. 
Underneath the bars there are three boxes in which you can set the value more precisely.
Beneath that there is the R-G-B value and then the HEX value.

In the bottom left corner are two buttons, a save button, and a delete button; the other this is just the logo.
The save button temporarily saves the R-G-B and HEX value so you can view them later.
The delete button removes the latest saved color.

To see the value of the saved color hover over the saved color.
You can set the curent color to the value of the saved color by clicking it.

To exit click the X button.

## Gradient

Gradient is a lot like Classic but there are two R-G-B inputs you also cannot see the HEX value.

## Fade

Fade is the slowest.
Like Gradient it has two color bars, but it also has four position sliders used to move blobs.

There are two blobs that do not initially appear, you have to change the color to see them.
